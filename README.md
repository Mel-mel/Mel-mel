Hello! My name is Melissa. Video gamer and software developer.

Interested in graphics, games, front end development, and cats. :smiley_cat:

I'm currently learning C#, React, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and SQL. 
And if I have spare time, I'll take a peek into Unity and dip my toes into Flutter apps
